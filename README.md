# Leeds Tracker App

A simple web app to track and save your favorite URLs. It allows you to:

- Save URLs manually by entering them in an input field.
- Save URLs from the current active tab in your browser.
- Clear all saved URLs with a double-click on the delete button.
- All saved URLs are persisted using `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Add URLs**: You can manually input a URL and save it to your list.
- **Add Current Tab URL**: With the "Add Tab" button, the URL of your current active browser tab is automatically added to the list.
- **Delete URLs**: The "Delete All" button removes all saved URLs.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saved URLs are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage`, so the list persists even after a page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling of the app (you can add custom styles).
- **JavaScript**: Logic for managing the list of URLs and interaction with `localStorage`.
